"Bloomin’ Algae is a Citizen Science app for reporting the presence of "
"harmful algal blooms of blue-green algae (also known as cyanobacteria). The "
"records you send in help speed up warnings to minimise risks to public and "
"animal health. You will receive feedback on the records you submit which can"
" help you learn how to recognise the risks to you and pets."
msgstr ""

# About Bloomin’ Algae info page content
msgid ""
"As well as submitting a photo and location details, we ask you to confirm "
"what general activities you, or others, are carrying out in, or around, the "
"water (such as dog walking). This is because blue-green algae pose a greater"
" risk to water-based activities, such as swimming or windsurfing, compared "
"to non-contact activities such as walking. They can pose a very high risk to"
" pets and livestock. By gathering details of activities undertaken we hope "
"to gain a better understanding of how algal blooms are impacting "
"recreational use of freshwaters."

# What are blue-green algae info page content

"Blue-green algae are actually a type of bacteria, known as cyanobacteria, "
"which produce toxic chemicals that are very harmful to the health of people "
"and animals. These algae naturally occur in all freshwaters, especially "
"lakes, reservoirs, canals and slow-moving rivers. They are microscopic but "
"clump together in visible colonies that can rise to the surface and form "
"thin wispy blooms or thick paint-like scums on the water surface if they get"
" very abundant. Shoreline scums and surface blooms (see ID guide in app) "
"pose severe health risks, particularly to animals that swim or drink the "
"water."

"The toxins that blue-green algae produce can result in a range of health "
"effects in people and animals. They cause skin rashes and much more severe "
"symptoms (fever, vomiting, liver damage) if swallowed. Dogs are especially "
"at risk if they drink contaminated water, or lick their coat after swimming,"
" with severe symptoms requiring very rapid vet treatment. Blue-green algae "
"have also caused the deaths of horses, cattle, birds and fish."
