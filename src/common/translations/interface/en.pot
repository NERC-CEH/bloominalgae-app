Blue-green algae can pose a very high risk to pets and livestock.

# What are blue-green algae info page content
msgid "Blue-green algae are a type of bacteria, known as cyanobacteria, which can produce toxic chemicals that are very harmful to the health of people and animals. These algae naturally occur in all freshwaters, especially lakes, reservoirs, canals and slow-moving rivers. They are microscopic but, when abundant, grow to be visible small green particles or flakes. In calm sunny weather, they can rise to the surface and form thin wispy streaks, or thick paint-like scums on the water surface if they get very abundant. Shoreline scums and surface blooms (see ID guide in app) pose severe health risks, particularly to animals that swim or drink the affected water."

msgid "Blooms of blue-green algae are most commonly seen during summer and early autumn months, particularly in calm and sunny weather, but they can linger in freshwaters into late autumn. They occasionally occur in winter and spring months. Most blooms are green but sometimes turquoise blue patches are seen on the water or along shorelines when the blooms start to decay. Some blooms are coloured red, dark brown or black."
