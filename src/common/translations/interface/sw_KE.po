"Bloomin’ Algae is a Citizen Science app for reporting the presence of "

"As well as submitting a photo and location details, we ask you to confirm "
"what general activities you, or others, are carrying out in, or around, the "
"water (such as dog walking). This is because blue-green algae pose a greater"
" risk to water-based activities, such as swimming or windsurfing, compared "
"to non-contact activities such as walking. Blue-green algae can pose a very "
"high risk to pets and livestock. By gathering details of activities "

"Blue-green algae are a type of bacteria, known as cyanobacteria, which can "
"produce toxic chemicals that are very harmful to the health of people and "
"animals. These algae naturally occur in all freshwaters, especially lakes, "
"reservoirs, canals and slow-moving rivers. They are microscopic but, when "
"abundant, grow to be visible small green particles or flakes. In calm sunny "
"weather, they can rise to the surface and form thin wispy streaks, or thick "
"paint-like scums on the water surface if they get very abundant. Shoreline "
"scums and surface blooms (see ID guide in app) pose severe health risks, "
"particularly to animals that swim or drink the affected water."
msgstr ""

# What are blue-green algae info page content
msgid ""
"Blooms of blue-green algae are most commonly seen during summer and early "
"autumn months, particularly in calm and sunny weather, but they can linger "
"in freshwaters into late autumn. They occasionally occur in winter and "
"spring months. Most blooms are green but sometimes turquoise blue patches "
"are seen on the water or along shorelines when the blooms start to decay. "
"Some blooms are coloured red, dark brown or black."
