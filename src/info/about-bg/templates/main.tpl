      Blue-green algae naturally occur in lakes, ponds, canals, rivers
      and reservoirs around the world. However they can produce toxins
      that are harmful to the health of people and animals. These algae
      are most commonly seen during the summer months, particularly in
      calm warm conditions. They are microscopic but clump together in
      visible colonies up to a few millimetres in size that can rise to
      the surface and form thin wispy blooms or thick paint-like scums
      if the numbers are very large.
