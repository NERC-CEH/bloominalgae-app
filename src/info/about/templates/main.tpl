      Both the Environment Agency (EA) and the Scottish Environment
      Protection Agency (SEPA) provide a blue-green algae analytical
      service and advice to local authorities, water body owners, managers
      etc.  However there is no routine national algal bloom monitoring
      system, and so records of past bloom events are patchy. By recording
      blue-green algal blooms through this app, we hope to get a better
      overall picture of the timing and location of algal blooms across
      the UK, to help inform local authorities and relevant health agencies
      of potential public health risks and aid the EA & SEPA in bloom
      management and prevention in the future.

      The app also asks you for details of what activities you are carrying
      out in or around the water, as blue-green algal blooms pose a greater
      risk to water-based activities, such as swimming or windsurfing,
      compared to non-contact activities such as walking. By gathering
      details of activities undertaken we hope to gain a better
      understanding of how algal blooms are impacting recreational
      use of freshwaters in the UK.

      When you submit a record the data is stored within the iRecord website,
      where it will be displayed to users and be examined and verified by an
      expert. Only your records are available publically, not your contact
      details. These records may be collated and disseminated for
      environmental decision-making, education, scientific research
      and other public benefit uses.
      Many thanks for taking part!
