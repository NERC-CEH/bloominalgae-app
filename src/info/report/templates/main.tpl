    <p>
      The responsibility to manage algal blooms lies with the owner of the
      water concerned. However, for enquiries relating to Blue-Green Algae
      (cyanobacteria), please contact the Environmental Health department
      in your local authority. Environmental Health will assess any action
      required against the relevant guidance and may contact the regulatory
      authority (EA, SEPA, NRW, EANI) for further water tests.  You may also
      report incidents of algal blooms or water pollution incidents to your
      environment regulatory authority.
