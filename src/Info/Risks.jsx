            Blue-Green algae (also known as cyanobacteria) can be harmful to the
            health of people and animals. Do NOT touch or ingest anything you
            suspect to be a bloom and do not allow pets or children to come into
            contact with, or swallow, the water.
          </P>

          <P>
            The toxins that blue-green algae produce can result in a range of
            health effects in people and animals. They cause skin rashes and
            much more severe symptoms if swallowed (fever, vomiting, liver
            damage).
          </P>

          <P>
            Dogs are especially at risk if they drink contaminated water, or
            lick their coat after swimming, with severe symptoms requiring very
            rapid vet treatment to avoid death. Blue-green algae have also
            caused the deaths of horses, cattle, birds and fish.
